                    After law studies and a number of experiences working in legal departments, I decided that I wanted to try something new.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    I decided to follow along The Odin Project to familiarize myself with web development, I really enjoyed learning along, discovering new ways to solve problems.

                    I chose web development mostly because I have always been interested in computers and IT in general since I was teenager thanks to my brother.                Although, at that time, I mostly wanted to play Diablo II while he was installing Linux distros on the family computer.

                    I am currently looking for work and to put my new skills to the test.
