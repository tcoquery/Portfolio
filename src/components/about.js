                    I have always been interested in computers and IT in general ever since I was teenager and watching my brother install Linux distros on the family computer. So naturally, I decided to study law.

                    After a number of experiences working in legal departments, I realized this industry wasn't the right fit for me. Finding a job both stimulating and stable was like trying to find a unicorn so I decided to switch careers.

                    After building computers as a teenager, I wanted to learn about the software part. With so many resources to learn and a field in constant evolution, web development became the obvious choice.
                    I taught myself using <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" class="underline">The Odin Project</a>, a free and open source web development curriculum.

                    In a matter of months, I had learned new languages and frameworks, and most of all, I enjoyed it. There's no better feeling than finding the solution to a problem you've been stuck on for a while.

                    I am now ready to put my new skills to use and would love to chat about employment opportunities.
